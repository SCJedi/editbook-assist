## 2. Physical Layout (User-Provided)

### Three-Wing U-Shape Configuration
- **Middle Wing**: Item 144-D (Wing Case with Table) — 240 cells, includes desk surface
- **Left Wing**: Typically Item 124-D or 143-D — folds in toward center
- **Right Wing**: Typically Item 124-D or 143-D — folds in toward center
- **Optional Add-On**: Sometimes a full or half wing is added on the right side
- **Carrier Position**: Carrier stands in the center of the U, facing the middle wing
- **Source**: USER-PROVIDED

### Shelf Configuration
- **6 shelves per wing** (universal across all equipment types)
- **Shelves numbered**: Bottom to top (shelf 1 = bottom, shelf 6 = top)
- **Source**: USER-PROVIDED + CONFIRMED in PO-603 references

### Casing Direction (Delivery Sequence Flow)
- **Start**: Bottom-left cell of the left wing
- **Pattern**: Serpentine/spiral upward
  - Shelf 1 (bottom): Left → Right
  - Shelf 2: Left → Right (or possibly Right → Left in true serpentine)
  - Continues upward through shelf 6 (top)
- **End**: Top-right cell of the right wing
- **Equipment Boundary Constraint**: An address cell MUST NOT split across equipment boundaries (e.g., a 4" address cannot be 2" on one wing and 2" on the next)
- **Source**: USER-PROVIDED
- **Status**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED - Research confirms delivery sequence casing, but exact left-right serpentine pattern details need verification

### Casing Pattern Variations
Research revealed two common organizational approaches:
1. **"Carousel" Pattern**: A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3... (horizontal across wings, then down)
2. **"Normal" Pattern**: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B1, B2, B3... (vertical within sections, then next section)
- **Source**: CONFIRMED - Rural Mail Talk forums, USPS training materials
- **Note**: The user's described bottom-left → spiral up → top-right matches the "Normal" pattern

### Management Discretion
- **Case setup is determined by management** when route is created
- **Changes allowed when**:
  - Regular route is vacant
  - Route changes regular carriers (with prior notification)
  - Anytime on auxiliary routes
  - Equipment becomes unserviceable
  - By mutual agreement between carrier and management

## 3. Reserved Cell Map - Form 3982 and Mail Status Codes

### Form 3982: Customer Special Instructions
- **Full Name**: PS Form 3982 (city carriers) / PS Form 3982-R (rural carriers)
- **Purpose**: Records customer address changes, special delivery instructions, and boxholder requests
- **Cell Placement**: ✅ CONFIRMED — **First 1" cell of each shelf row** (start of each row)
- **Width**: 1 inch per cell
- **Total Form 3982 cells**: **6 for the entire case** (one per shelf row, at the very start of the left wing)
- **NOT per wing** — only at the start of each row (which begins on the left wing)
- **Source**: USER-CONFIRMED

### First-Shelf Reserved Cells: Mail Status Codes
- **Count**: ✅ CONFIRMED — **8 reserved cells (8 inches)**
- **Position**: ✅ CONFIRMED — **Always the last 8 cells of the first shelf** (end of Row 1)
- **Source**: USER-CONFIRMED

#### Exact Status Code Layout (Left to Right, last 8 cells of Row 1)

| Cell | Code | Width | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | MACHINEABLE | 1" | Machine-processable mail |
| 2-3 | NON-MACHINEABLE | 2" | Non-machine-processable mail |
| 4 | UTF | 1" | Unable to Forward |
| 5 | IA | 1" | Insufficient Address |
| 6 | NSN | 1" | No Such Number |
| 7 | ANK | 1" | Attempted Not Known |
| 8 | OTHER | 1" | Catch-all for other status codes |
| **Total** | | **8"** | |

### Reserved Cell Summary

| Reserved Type | Position | Count | Scope |
|--------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Form 3982 | First cell of each shelf row | **6 total** | Entire case (1 per row) |
| Status Codes | Last 8 cells of Row 1 | **8 total** | End of first shelf |
| **Total Reserved** | | | **14 cells** |

## 4. Cell Sizing Rules and Constraints

### Base Cell Unit
- **Standard width**: 1 inch per cell
- **Adjustability**: Dividers are removable; cells can be widened
- **Multi-cell addresses**: An address can span multiple cells (e.g., 2", 4", etc.) for high mail volume
- **Source**: CONFIRMED - PO-603

### Equipment Boundary Constraint
- **Rule**: An address cell MUST NOT split across equipment boundaries
- **Example**: A 4" address cannot be 2" on left wing and 2" on middle wing
- **Implication**: When calculating cell layout, addresses nearing equipment boundaries must either:
  - Fit entirely on current wing, OR
  - Begin on the next wing
- **Source**: USER-PROVIDED

### Cell Size Variation by Route
- **Standard**: 1" per address
- **Alternate configurations**:
  - 2" separations with two deliveries per separation
  - Variable widths based on mail volume characteristics
  - Some routes have been compressed (e.g., 70 addresses in 7 slots = ~2" wide multi-address cells)
- **Management discretion**: Managers may vary separation size and deliveries per separation based on route mail volume
- **Source**: CONFIRMED - M-38 handbook, Rural Mail Talk forums

### Letter vs. Flat Mail
- **Letter mail**: Cased vertically (standard cell arrangement)
- **Flat mail**: Cased horizontally in wider separations (10" slots mentioned in PO-603)
- **Source**: CONFIRMED - M-41, M-38 handbooks

## 5. Casing Flow Pattern - CONFIRMED

### ✅ Flow Pattern (User-Confirmed)

The casing flow goes **horizontally across all wings on the same shelf**, then moves up to the next shelf:

```
SHELF 6: [Left Wing Row 6] → [Middle Wing Row 6] → [Right Wing Row 6]  ← END (last address)
SHELF 5: [Left Wing Row 5] → [Middle Wing Row 5] → [Right Wing Row 5]
SHELF 4: [Left Wing Row 4] → [Middle Wing Row 4] → [Right Wing Row 4]
SHELF 3: [Left Wing Row 3] → [Middle Wing Row 3] → [Right Wing Row 3]
SHELF 2: [Left Wing Row 2] → [Middle Wing Row 2] → [Right Wing Row 2]
SHELF 1: [Left Wing Row 1] → [Middle Wing Row 1] → [Right Wing Row 1]  ← START (first address)
```

### Row-by-Row Breakdown (Standard 3-Wing: 124-D + 144-D + 124-D)

Each row spans all wings on the same shelf:
- **Left Wing (124-D)**: 240 ÷ 6 = **40 cells per row**
- **Middle Wing (144-D)**: 240 ÷ 6 = **40 cells per row**
- **Right Wing (124-D)**: 240 ÷ 6 = **40 cells per row**
- **Total cells per row**: 40 + 40 + 40 = **120 cells per row**
- **Total rows**: 6
- **Grand total**: 720 cells

### Row 1 (Bottom Shelf) Special Layout
```
[3982][--------- addresses ---------][Left Wing end] → [--------- addresses ---------][Middle Wing end] → [--- addresses ---][MACH|NON-MACH|UTF|IA|NSN|ANK|OTHER]
  1"         39 cells                                          40 cells                                      32 cells            1" | 2" |1"|1"|1" |1" | 1"
```

- Form 3982: 1" cell at START of row (left wing, cell 1) — **1 cell on Row 1**
- Reserved status codes: last 8 cells of the row (end of right wing) — **8 cells**
- Usable address cells on Row 1: 120 - 1 (Form 3982) - 8 (status codes) = **111 cells**

### Rows 2-6 Layout
```
[3982][--------- addresses ---------][Left Wing end] → [--------- addresses ---------][Middle Wing end] → [--------- addresses ---------][Right Wing end]
  1"         39 cells                                          40 cells                                             40 cells
```

- Form 3982: 1" cell at START of row (left wing, cell 1) — **1 cell per row**
- Usable address cells per row (Rows 2-6): 120 - 1 = **119 cells each**

### Total Usable Address Cells (Standard 3-Wing)
| Row | Total Cells | Form 3982 | Status Codes | Usable |
|-----|-------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 120 | 1 | 8 | **111** |
| 2 | 120 | 1 | 0 | **119** |
| 3 | 120 | 1 | 0 | **119** |
| 4 | 120 | 1 | 0 | **119** |
| 5 | 120 | 1 | 0 | **119** |
| 6 | 120 | 1 | 0 | **119** |
| **Total** | **720** | **6** | **8** | **706** |

### Equipment Configuration Options
| Config | Left | Middle | Right | Extra | Total Cells | Reserved | Usable |
|--------|------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Standard 3-wing | 124-D (240) | 144-D (240) | 124-D (240) | none | 720 | 14 | **706** |
| 3-wing + half | 124-D (240) | 144-D (240) | 124-D (240) | 143-D (120) | 840 | 14 | **826** |
| 3-wing + full | 124-D (240) | 144-D (240) | 124-D (240) | 144-D (240) | 960 | 14 | **946** |

*Reserved = 6 Form 3982 (entire case) + 8 status codes (last 8 of Row 1) = 14 total

### Key Constraint
**Address cells CANNOT split across wing boundaries.** A 4" address near the end of a wing's row must either fit entirely on that wing or start on the next wing, leaving dead space.

## 6. What We Confirmed vs. What We Still Need

### CONFIRMED (Official USPS Sources)
✅ Item 124-D: 240 cells (1" wide), 6 shelves, 40 cells/shelf
✅ Item 143-D: 120 cells, 6 shelves, 20 cells/shelf
✅ Item 144-D: 240 cells (1" wide), 6 shelves, 40 cells/shelf, includes table
✅ Standard route: 3 pieces of equipment = 720 cells total
✅ Cells are 1" base unit, dividers removable for wider cells
✅ Mail status codes exist: NSN, ANK, VAC, UTF, DEC
✅ Form 3982 is used for special instructions and is cased
✅ Throwback cases exist for undeliverable mail
✅ Mail is cased in delivery sequence order
✅ Letter mail cased vertically, flat mail cased horizontally
✅ Management has discretion over case configuration

### USER-PROVIDED (Insider Knowledge from Active Carrier)
📋 3-wing U-shape layout (left wing, middle wing with desk, right wing)
📋 Carrier stands in center of U
📋 Casing direction: bottom-left → spiral up → top-right
📋 Address cells cannot split across equipment boundaries
📋 Form 3982 cell: 1" at start or end of each shelf row
📋 First shelf reserved cells at the end for NSN, ANK, VAC, UTF, etc.
📋 Each reserved status code gets 1" cell
📋 Optional half-wing or full wing can be added on right side

### INFERRED (Reasonable Deductions)
💡 124-D with 240 cells ÷ 6 shelves = 40 cells/shelf
💡 143-D with 120 cells ÷ 6 shelves = 20 cells/shelf
💡 If standard route has 3 wings of 240 cells each, typical setup is Item 124-D (left) + Item 144-D (middle, with desk) + Item 124-D (right)
💡 Form 3982 cells on 6 shelves × 3 wings = 18 cells if at start/end of every shelf
💡 First shelf reserved cells (5-10 codes × 1" each) = 5-10 inches

### NOW CONFIRMED (Answered by User)
✅ Form 3982 cell placement — first 1" cell of each shelf (start of every row)
✅ Form 3982 on every shelf — yes, all 6 shelves on every wing
✅ Reserved status code count — 8 cells, last 8 of first row
✅ Casing flow pattern — horizontal across all wings on same shelf, then up to next shelf (NOT serpentine, NOT per-wing)
✅ Wing transition — stays on same shelf, flows left wing → middle wing → right wing, then up
✅ Equipment config — Left 124-D + Middle 144-D + Right 124-D (standard), optional 143-D or 144-D extra
✅ Cells per row formula — wing total cells ÷ 6 shelves = cells per row for that wing

### REMAINING UNKNOWNS
❓ Physical dimensions of wing equipment (height, width, depth in inches/cm)?
❓ Which exact 8 status codes fill the reserved cells? (NSN, ANK, VAC, UTF, DEC confirmed = 5, need the other 3)
❓ Are throwback case cells separate from the main carrier case reserved cells?
❓ Does the optional extra wing also get Form 3982 cells on each shelf?
❓ When a 4th wing is added, do the 8 reserved status cells stay at the end of the right-most wing's row 1, or still at the end of the 3rd wing?

## 8. Next Steps for Research

To complete the specifications, we need to:

1. **Obtain official USPS equipment diagrams** from PO-603 or M-38 full PDFs (download and examine exhibits)
2. **Interview additional rural carriers** to confirm:
   - Form 3982 cell placement (start vs. end of shelves)
   - Complete list of first-shelf reserved status codes
   - Exact casing flow pattern (serpentine vs. uniform)
   - Wing transition behavior
3. **Contact NRLCA or USPS equipment suppliers** for:
   - Physical dimensions of each equipment item
   - Specifications for optional half-wing or additional wings
   - Item numbers for all optional equipment
4. **Review M-39 Exhibit 126.13** ("Typical Labeling Pattern Carrier Throwback Case") for throwback case layout
5. **Clarify relationship** between main case reserved cells and throwback case cells
